Let's create app router Next.js AI shopping assistant, aiming to help users find the best products on the internet based on their needs. Lets call it Shoppy.
I want to have two pages: landing page and the assistant chat itself.
Landing page should have standard navigation at the top, with the logo on on the right and navigation items on the right. Navigation items will be: Benefits, Pricing, Contact and Try for Free. "Benefits", "Pricing" and "Contact" click should scroll to the corresponding section on landing page and "Try for Free" should be a nice, standing out Next.js <Link /> to assistant chat route. We will take care of that route later.
Make banner with slick, engaging slogan, smaller text and button "Try for Free", also as <Link /> leading to the chat route. Below think of some benefits and show them in original, eye-catching way. Under benefits should be pricing in three boxes with the best one in the middle and under pricing create the contact section.
I want this project to be futurictic. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion to make site more dynamic and interactive. You can use some images. Remember about responsiveness.

Implement a mobile menu for smaller screens. Add more interactive elements or animations. Add a small, barely visible dots in the background to make it look like space.

Implement some gradients. Use tailwind indigo as your base color. Add light/dark theme.

Instead of dots make the background look like the grid notebook, with really thin lines

thats cool, make the grid twice as big and fill the random ones with the theme color

I want to have random cells filled, but don't want to have so many divs reloading on resize all the time, can we do it more wisely, efficently?

Ok, grid background looks cool, but add the background gradient as well as it was at the beggining

Add some slow gradient and shadow movement to the hero h1 and typing effect to the p element all the buttons should have delicate shadow. Benefit cards should be moving dynamically on mouse move on them. Icons on benefits cards can have slight shadow as well.

I meant that cards should move dynamically in direction the mouse hovers them. I want page to be more interactive.
